# UltralightProbeMicrodrive
Ultra-light microdrive design for implanted multichannel neural recording probes. 
Remixed from the [microdrive](https://github.com/buzsakilab/3d_print_designs/tree/master/Microdrives/Metal_recoverable) 
designed by Mihály Vöröslakos in the Buzsaki Lab, using a shoulder-screw inspired by the Open Ephys 
[shuttledrive](https://github.com/open-ephys/shuttle-drive) and
[Jadhav Lab](https://gitlab.com/JMOlson/TetDrive-Jadhav-Metal) designs. **Total weight is ~0.7g.**

Microdrive design is in the `microdrive/` directory. We have printed the microdrive
components using our Projet MJP2500 printer. A number of options exist for MJP2500 prints.
We have had good success with parts recevied from [CadBlu NYC](https://www.cadblu.com/). They
are a distributor for these printers but also print-as-a-service. 
For the shuttle part, we have had good success with lost-wax cast metals. Originally
[Shapeways](https://www.shapeways.com/fragments/product?spin=3TFFV6T2Q) was an easy source,
but since their bankruptcy, we have had success with parts cast from Bronze purchased
via the [CraftCloud3d](https://craftcloud3d.com) marketplace. Bronze is listed in their
"Precious Metals" category. The "Raw" finish was more than adequate. We ordered from a supplier
called "3D Print India" and were quite pleased with both the price and the result.

If you want to print the shuttle in plastic rather than metal, we suggest using the 
["for plastic" STL file](https://github.com/ckemere/UltralightProbeMicrodrive/blob/main/microdrive/components/shuttle-split-for-plastic-print.STL).

We have had the custom screws bid on [MFG.com](https://MFG.com), and manufactured 
by [https://g-machining.com/](https://g-machining.com/).
_Contact us with questions, we can provide a small number of screws for testing at cost._

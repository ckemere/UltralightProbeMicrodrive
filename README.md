# UltralightProbeMicrodrive
Ultra-light microdrive design for implanted multichannel neural recording probes. 
Remixed from the [microdrive](https://github.com/buzsakilab/3d_print_designs/tree/master/Microdrives/Metal_recoverable) 
designed by Mihály Vöröslakos in the Buzsaki Lab, using a shoulder-screw inspired by the Open Ephys 
[shuttledrive](https://github.com/open-ephys/shuttle-drive) and
[Jadhav Lab](https://gitlab.com/JMOlson/TetDrive-Jadhav-Metal) designs. **Total weight is ~0.7g.**

Microdrive design is in the `microdrive/` directory. We have printed the microdrive
components using our Projet MJP2500 printer. We have also obtained them from
Shapeways. We use the brass or gold-plated brass process for the shutte part:

The other components we print using the "Fine Detail Plastic"/"Clear Ultra" option.
Total cost for one microdrive is ~$35 without shipping and handling. If you want to
print the shuttle in plastic rather than metal, we suggest using the 
["for plastic" STL file](https://github.com/ckemere/UltralightProbeMicrodrive/blob/main/microdrive/components/shuttle-split-for-plastic-print.STL).

We have had the custom screws manufactured by [https://g-machining.com/](https://g-machining.com/).
The threading is slightly different from what is obtained using the M0.8 tap available
from McMaster-Carr, so we tap the shuttle using one of the custom screws (very slowly).
_Contact us with questions, we can provide a small number of screws for testing at cost._

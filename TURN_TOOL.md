# Constructing an Adjustment Tool

Compared to a standard flat head or Phillips (cross drive), the half-cylinder head of the screws
has the advantage of allowing for repeated turning without significant wear. But since it's non standard,
you'll need to construct your own driver tool. 

## Simple Recipe

A simple recipe uses hypodermic tubing in the 16 and 18 gauge sizes (regular wall, available, for example,
at [Component Supply](https://componentsupplycompany.com/product-pages/hypodermictubing.php), and one of
the half-cylinder screws which will be sacrificed to make the mating head inside the tool.

1. The 16 ga tubing will serve as the handle of the tool (unless you use a pin vise or other, fancier,
handle). So cut it long enough to hold comfortably (> 6 cm). 16 ga regular wall tubing has an internal
diameter that just barely admits the entire head of the screw.

2. The 18 ga tubing stabilizes the screw that is used to construct the drive head of the tool. 18 ga tubing
fits precisely inside the 16 ga rw tubing. Its inner diameter tightly contains the threaded part of the
sacrficial tool. This ensures alignment. Thus, the 18 ga tubing needs only to be long enough to contain
the threads of the screw, ~ 1 cm.

3. Cut a couple of slots into the 18 ga tubing, and at least one near the top of the 16 ga tubing. We will
use cyanoacrylate glue to fix everything together, and the slots serve to ensure good binding between
the otherwise very smooth hypodermic surfaces.

4. Put a drop of glue into the 18 ga tube, and insert the screw completely (the threaded part will go in
but not the head). Clean excess glue off the outside and let the glue dry.

5. Once the glue has dried, glue the 18 ga tube / screw assembly into the 16 ga tube. Put a small drop
of glue into the top of the 16 ga tube (the end with the slot in it). Insert the 18 ga tube/screw assembly
and push it in until almost flush - you want the head of the mating screw to be mostly encased by the 16 ga
but not inserted so far that it's top is below the end of the 16 ga (because then it wouldn't mate completely).
If you push it too far by accident, you can stick another tube through the back end of the 16 ga tube to push
it back out before the glue dries.

6. Once the glue has dried completely, you can put a piece of heatshrink on the end of your adjustment tool
to make it easier to hold on to or insert it into a pin vice for a nicer handle!
